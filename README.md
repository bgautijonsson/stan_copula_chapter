# Stan Copula Chapter

This repository contains my work on the "Copulas" chapter for the Stan Users Guide.

A preview rendered as a github page can be found [here](https://bggj.is/copulas-stan-chapter/).

## Overview

The chapter introduces copulas in Stan, focusing on implementation techniques and practical examples. Copulas provide a flexible way to model multivariate distributions by separating the marginal distributions from the dependence structure.

## Chapter Contents

- Introduction to copulas and Sklar's theorem
- General structure of copula models in Stan
- Gaussian copula implementation with exponential marginals
- Advantages of using copulas
- Overview of common copula families

This is an initial version of the chapter, with plans to expand it in the future.
